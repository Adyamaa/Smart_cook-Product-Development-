We started our journey to help the amateur cooks to cook in an easier way by using our device, but we realized from the customer feedback that our product could serve good food to every household of the globe. People need food to survive, but not everybody is a good cook. Also, some people have time constraints to engage in the act. Even those who are experts in the act sometimes get accidental heat injuries in the process. At old age, cooking one's own food becomes more challenging. So, we choose to design a smart cooking device that will take care of doing this vital activity in the best possible way, hopefully to the delight of every human palate. In our survey and the interviews, we came across some vital opinions to include in our product functionalities and system characteristics. To our delight, most of the interviewees seemed to be very satisfied with our product.  
All the standard procedures of product development like(Voice of Customer, QFD diagram, Critical customer requirement, Protection strategy, detailed manufacturing strategy, selling strategy) are used in this project.
